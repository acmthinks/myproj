#Spring Cloud Config Server (Netflix OSS) example
This is a simple example of a centralized configuration service. This can be deployed locally, in IBM Cloud (IBM Kubernetes Services). 

##IBM Cloud deployments
Designed to deploy on Kubernetes Service with IBM Container Services, but any k8s service provider should do.


To build local:
~/myproj> mvn clean install
